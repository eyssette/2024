# The Political Turn in Animal Ethics

The "political turn" in animal ethics refers to a shift in focus within the field of animal ethics from primarily moral and philosophical debates to more explicitly political concerns. This turn emerged as a response to the perceived limitations of traditional animal ethics, which often centered on individual moral obligations or abstract principles like utilitarianism or rights-based approaches. While these approaches advanced the field, they often lacked engagement with the practical, structural, and institutional factors that influence human-animal relationships. The political turn aims to address these gaps by integrating animals into political theories, frameworks, and institutions, emphasizing collective action and justice rather than just individual moral responsibility.

### Key Features of the Political Turn

#### 1/ Focus on Structural Issues

Advocates of the political turn argue that animal ethics must grapple with systemic structures—legal, economic, social, and political—rather than relying solely on personal moral responsibility. For example, it critiques how capitalism, industrial agriculture, and global trade shape the exploitation of animals on a massive scale, beyond what individual choices like veganism can address.

#### 2/ Justice for Animals as Political Subjects

The political turn often frames animals not just as beings with moral worth but as subjects of justice. This includes examining how animals can be included in political communities, legal systems, and institutions. Scholars like Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, in their book Zoopolis, argue for extending concepts of citizenship, sovereignty, and denizenship to animals, depending on their relationship to human society (e.g., domesticated animals as "citizens," wild animals as members of sovereign communities).

#### 3/ Human-Animal Relations as Political Relationships
This approach recognizes that human-animal relationships are inherently political because they involve power dynamics, governance, and resource distribution. The political turn interrogates these relationships, asking how policies, laws, and institutions perpetuate animal exploitation and what changes could create a more just society for both humans and animals.

#### 4/ Collective Action and Social Movements
The political turn emphasizes the role of collective action in addressing animal injustice. This includes building coalitions between animal advocacy groups and other social justice movements, such as environmentalism, feminism, and anti-racism. The aim is to create an intersectional approach that situates animal rights within broader struggles for systemic change.
