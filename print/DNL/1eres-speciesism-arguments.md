## Humans Have Superior Cognitive Abilities
Humans possess higher cognitive capacities—such as rational thought, self-awareness, language, and moral agency—that justify prioritizing human interests over those of other animals.

## Humans Are Unique in Their Ability to Create Culture and Morality
Unlike other animals, humans have established complex cultures, moral systems, and technologies. This uniqueness is seen as justifying a moral distinction between humans and non-human animals.

## Biological Continuity with Human Interests
Evolutionarily and biologically, humans naturally prioritize their own species, as this is consistent with survival instincts and the propagation of human genetics.

## Species Loyalty as an Ethical Priority
Humans tend to be loyal to their own kind in the same way individuals might favor their family or community. This loyalty is argued as a natural and ethical basis for speciesism.

## Practical Necessity in Society
Human societies depend on animal agriculture, animal testing, and other uses of animals for food, medicine, and scientific advancement. Some argue that these practices are essential for human well-being and development.

## Religious or Cultural Beliefs
Some religious or cultural beliefs place humans at the top of a hierarchy of creation, where humans are given dominion over animals, reinforcing the notion that humans should be prioritized over other species.

## Humans Have Complex Emotional and Social Relationships
Humans build intricate emotional and social relationships, including bonds of friendship, family, and community, which animals do not form in the same way. This unique capacity justifies treating humans with higher moral regard.

## Non-Human Animals Lack Moral Responsibility
Animals do not understand or follow human moral codes and cannot be held accountable for their actions. This perceived lack of moral agency suggests that they do not possess moral rights in the same way humans do.

## Humans Have Stewardship Over Nature
Many argue that humans, due to their intelligence and dominance, have a natural role as stewards of the Earth. This stewardship is taken to imply a hierarchy where human interests are prioritized, as humans are seen as protectors and managers of nature, including animals.
