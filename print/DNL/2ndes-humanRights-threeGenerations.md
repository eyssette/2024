# Three generations of human rights

The world is made up of many different countries, cultures and peoples. Yet despite all these differences, they all have one important thing in common: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” This is what it says in the very first Article of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* of 10 December 1948\. The notion of human rights has become one of the most important in the history of humankind.

## But what exactly are human rights? Who is responsible for protecting them? And do they really apply to all people?

We describe human rights as those rights which apply to every single person simply because s/he is a human being. They are innate. Human rights apply to every person in every part of the world, without exception. They are therefore universal.  

They also apply equally to everyone regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, skin colour, age or other features that may distinguish one person from another.   

Human rights are part of international law. The *UN Charter* of 1945 already contained important passages on the meaning and protection of human rights.   
The first proper international agreement was the *UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights* in 1948\.  

In 1966 the UN adopted two more International Covenants – one on Civil and Political Rights and the other on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These declarations are collectively known as the International Bill of Human Rights, and are the most important legal basis for human rights.  

In addition there is a whole series of UN Conventions– for example, the *Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees*, the *Convention on the Rights of the Child*, the *Convention against Torture* or recently the *UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities*. 

## But what are the specific human rights anchored in these Conventions?

Human rights are often divided into three generations or dimensions.  

- *The first dimension:* the classic political and civil liberty rights. These include the right to life and physical integrity. A ban on slavery and forced labour. Protection from torture. Freedom of thought, conscience and religion. A comprehensive ban on discrimination. And the right to vote.  
- *The second dimension:* The economic, social and cultural human rights. These include the right to work and to a decent wage. The right to form trade unions. Equality between men and women. The protection of families, pregnant women, mothers and children. The right to a decent standard of living, including the right to adequate food. The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. The right to education or the right to participate in cultural life.  
- *The third dimension* deals with the rights of groups: It includes the right to self-determination. The right to development. The right to a clean environment and the right to peace.   

The principle of the indivisibility of human rights is important. That means: None of the rights listed in the political, economic and social and cultural human rights may have precedence over the others. Human rights can only be consummated when all facets work together. The exercise of civil and political rights depends on the safeguarding of economic, social and cultural rights – and vice versa.
