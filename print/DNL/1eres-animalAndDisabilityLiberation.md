# Animal & Disability Liberation – with Sunaura Taylor

<https://justwondering.io/animal-disability-liberation-with-sunaura-taylor/>

## Disabled bodies and ableism

Sunaura Taylor is an artist, writer and activist for disability and animal rights. She was born with arthrogryposis, which was simply her embodiment. But later, as a child, when she couldn’t dance like other kids,  she realized something was different about her. Kids can be mean, and they would call her “monkey”... which was supposed to be an insult,  so she felt it as such, although actually, she loved monkeys.

In her book, “Beasts of Burden”, Taylor draws some lines of connection between  two movements which have been at odds: animal rights and disability rights. So let’s start with what bodies can and cannot do. There are two main models of disability: the medical model and the social model. The medical model sees disability as something to be “fixed” and cured, something that is a matter of the individual body, a body that defies norms of health in negative ways. The social model, on the other hand, takes a broader view of disability, pointing to how it is enmeshed into the social and material environment, and that it is not purely a matter of curing the individual, but of organizing society. The social model doesn’t deny there might be a need for doctors or medicine, but it stands to say that access is a question of justice, and that disability is often given by how the environment is shaped.Imagine if we had more ramps, instead of stairs, more braille instead of latin alphabet, more sign language instead of oral language - none of these ways of moving and communicating are more ‘natural’ than the other, but they are more advantageous for some abilities rather than others.

As people living in ableist societies, we’ve most probably thought in ableist terms without even realizing. So...What is ableism? It is prejudice against disabled people, and it carries suppositions of what they can do and what their lives can be like. It can lead to discrimination, such as lack of access to jobs and education, and it breeds systems of oppression that value one form of embodiment over another. Disability rights activists have worked a lot to challenge ableism in many ways, including showing how disability can foster other, creative ways of knowing and being in the world. Bodies are surprising, and they can act in various ways, not just what we’re accustomed with. Disabled people have often surprised the medical community not only with living longer than predicted, but also with having better, richer lives, defying standards of what is possible and desirable.

## Animal and disability liberation are entangled

What does all of this have to do with non-human animals? Well, there’s a catch. Disabled people have often been demeaned and considered less worthy because of what they can and cannot do, being sometimes compared to animals, thus ‘animalized’. This carries a huge risk to their lives, as nonhuman animal lives are, most of the time, considered disposable. In her book, Taylor is trying to argue how, following the way ableism organizes the worth of lives and of bodies in connection to their capacities, animal and disability liberation are entangled. Animals are often considered less worthy because, according to (hu)man norms and environments, they are less capable. They do not speak human languages perfectly nor do they engage in mathematics to a high degree. Therefore, it is not only disabled humans who suffer from ableism, but non-human beings, as well.

This comparison carries weight. One might breathe in. When making this argument, Taylor was accused of comparing herself to an animal, of degrading herself, as if she was not having enough disability pride and acceptance for her body. She answered carefully that she is actually pointing to the source of oppression: ableism as a mechanism of valuing some capabilities and not others, and of ordering even the worth of lives based on that.
However, she thought, why should it be so terrible to be compared to an animal anyway? This judgement relies heavily on speciesism, the belief in human superiority over other animals, which ends up justifying the use of nonhuman animal bodies and the domination over their lives. Speciesism allows us to take animal lives simply because they are not human. But, as many writers have shown, it can always be used against humans, as: “to call someone an animal is to render them a being to whom one does not have responsibilities, a being that can be shamelessly objectified”.

Sunaura Taylor then asks us: “What if instead of demeaning us, claiming animality could be a way of challenging the violence of animalization and of speciesism—of recognizing that animal liberation is entangled with our own?” So she does just that in her many painted self-portraits with bisons, bears, pigs and other nonhuman animals. But she is cautious, she knows this risk is not easy for everyone to take up. As a white woman who had access to education, Taylor highlights that closeness to animality might come painlessly to her, without a terrible cost. However, it is not being animal that scares us so much - humans are, after all, animals - but the dehumanization and objectification that comes with it. These are not abstractions: we must recognize entire histories of racist, ableist and sexist exploitation and oppression justified by claiming similarity with “the animal”. Just remember that there were such things as zoos which imprisoned human beings for show. And that now, there are, still, zoos that imprison nonhuman beings, some of which give them antidepressants to help them cope with living in captivity.
