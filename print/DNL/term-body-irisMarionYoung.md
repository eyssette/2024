Iris Marion Young, a prominent feminist philosopher, has explored the significance of the body in shaping personal identity and selfhood. In her work, she emphasizes the embodied nature of human existence and argues that the body plays a crucial role in defining one’s sense of self.
Young challenges traditional views that separate the mind from the body and suggests that our physical experiences and the way society perceives our bodies significantly impact our identity. She contends that the body is not just a passive vessel but an active agent in shaping our lived experiences and self-perception.

Iris Marion Young’s conceptualization of the body diverges from a simple biological perspective. For Young, the body transcends its biological functions to become a complex entity intertwined with social and cultural dimensions. She explores how the cultural construction of femininity or masculinity can shape the way individuals relate to their own bodies and how others perceive them.

One of the sources of the modalities of feminine bodily existence is too obvious to dwell upon at length. For the most part, girls and women are not given the opportunity to use their full bodily capacities in free and open engagement with the world, nor are they encouraged as much as boys to develop specific bodily skills.

In a series of essays written early in her career, Young captured everyday experiences of women’s embodiment. Such accounts were not simply descriptive, but were aimed, initially, to make evident the way in which the social norms governing female “bodily comportment” yielded an inhibited intentionality, an interruption in the pre-reflexive engagement with our environment to which Merleau-Ponty had drawn our attention. So, for example, in “Throwing Like A Girl” (1980) she points to studies which suggest that girls and boys throw in different ways and that women, when attempting physical tasks, frequently fail to use the physical possibilities of their bodies. Young suggests that the inhibited intentionality characteristic of female embodiment derives from the fact that women often experience their bodies as things/objects, “looked at and acted upon”. “She often lives her body as a burden, which must be dragged and prodded along, and at the same time protected”. For Young, such experiences of embodiment are not a consequence of anatomy, but rather of the situation of women in contemporary society.
