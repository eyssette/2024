**Anthropocentrism** is an ethical framework that positions humans at the center of moral consideration, asserting that human beings hold a superior moral status compared to non-human entities. This perspective emphasizes human interests, rights, and welfare as primary concerns in ethical decision-making, often justifying the exploitation of natural resources and non-human animals for human benefit.

The justification for this anthropocentric view can be rooted in **exceptionalism**, which argues that humans possess unique qualities that set them apart from all other species, such as advanced cognitive abilities, emotional depth, and moral reasoning. This uniqueness is seen as the basis for a moral hierarchy where humans occupy the top position.

From the perspective of critics, both anthropocentrism and exceptionalism are considered forms of **speciesism**. The term speciesism was coined in the 1970s by British psychologist Richard Ryder, and it refers to the unequal treatment of beings based solely on their species membership. Just as racism is an arbitrary discrimination based on race and sexism is an arbitrary discrimination based on gender, speciesism is an arbitrary discrimination based solely on the classification within a specific biological category.
