# Breaking the Mechanistic View: <br>How We See Animals Differently Today

Historically, animals were often regarded as mere objects or things, with little to no recognition of their intrinsic value or capacity for suffering. One of the most influential views that reinforced this perception came from the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes. Descartes famously argued that animals were "automata," or biological machines, devoid of consciousness, emotions, or a soul. According to his theory, animals could perform complex actions, but these were purely mechanical responses to external stimuli. They were seen as living machines, driven by instinct and devoid of the rational thought that, for Descartes, distinguished humans from other creatures. This perspective led to a justification for the use of animals in experiments and harsh treatment, as their pain or suffering was considered inconsequential – mere physical reactions, not experiences of conscious beings.

However, this view of animals has gradually evolved over time. Scientific advances, particularly in fields like biology, ethology, and neuroscience, have demonstrated that many animals are far more complex than Descartes could have imagined. Research has shown that animals possess varying degrees of intelligence, emotional capacities, and even social behaviors that closely resemble human traits. Philosophical and ethical discussions have also begun to challenge the Cartesian notion of animals as mere objects. Today, many people recognize animals as sentient beings capable of suffering, deserving of moral consideration and protection. As our understanding of the natural world deepens, the outdated view of animals as machines is being replaced by a more compassionate and informed perspective, where animals are seen as beings with intrinsic value and rights.
