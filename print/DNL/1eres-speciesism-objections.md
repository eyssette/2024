## Cognitive Capacity Does Not Determine Moral Worth
Cognitive ability or intelligence is not a morally relevant criterion for determining an entity's right to be treated ethically. Many humans with lower cognitive function (e.g., infants, people with cognitive disabilities) are still granted moral consideration.

## Non-Human Animals Exhibit Unique Qualities and Societies
Many animals exhibit complex social behaviors, tool use, emotional depth, and even cultural traditions, blurring the lines between human and non-human capabilities and challenging the basis for elevating humans above animals.

## Evolution Does Not Justify Moral Superiority
While humans may have evolved with a preference for their own kind, natural inclinations do not justify moral decisions. Ethical frameworks should be based on principles beyond mere survival instincts.

## Moral Consideration Should Extend Beyond Species Boundaries
Loyalty to oneâ€™s species does not justify harm or exploitation of others. Just as humans reject discrimination based on race or gender, ethical consistency would suggest that species should not be a morally relevant factor in determining rights.

## Alternative Methods Reduce Dependence on Animals
The necessity of animal use is increasingly questioned, with advancements in technology providing alternatives (e.g., plant-based diets, lab-grown meat, non-animal testing methods) that reduce the need for animal exploitation.

## Religious or Cultural Norms Are Not Universal Morality
Moral principles grounded in religious or cultural beliefs may not be universally valid or ethically sound. Ethical treatment of animals can be argued independently of specific religious or cultural frameworks.

## Emotional and Social Complexity Does Not Determine Moral Priority
The presence of complex social relationships among humans does not justify a higher moral status. Just as we grant moral consideration to humans regardless of their social connectedness or relationship depth (such as isolated individuals or those with limited social abilities), non-human animals deserve ethical consideration based on their capacity to suffer and feel emotions, rather than the complexity of their social structures.

## Moral Responsibility Is Not a Criterion for Moral Worth
Moral worth does not necessarily hinge on an individual's ability to comprehend moral codes. Infants and some individuals with disabilities, for example, are not held morally responsible yet are still deserving of ethical treatment. Likewise, animals can be deserving of moral consideration even if they lack moral agency.

## Stewardship Does Not Justify Exploitation
The concept of stewardship should imply responsibility and care, not dominance or exploitation. True stewardship would involve protecting animals and the environment, rather than prioritizing human interests at the expense of animal welfare. Ethical stewardship suggests a duty to respect the intrinsic value of all living beings, not just those that benefit humans.
